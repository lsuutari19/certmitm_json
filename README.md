# certmitm

## This is a branch with following modifications:
a new flag --output-json which is very scuffed at the moment, it needs to be made asynchronous or we need to have it create new files constantly since it is being called in 8 different sections in threaded functions...
it will create two new files currently to the outputs folder that are named "outputs_<datetime>.json" & "critical_outputs_<datetime>.json" the first one is for all outputs and the second one is only for critical outputs.

Current issues:
* If too many functions try to write to the file at the same time it will JSONDecodeError (at least thats my intuition, needs more research)
* Above is most likely caused by the part where we write the SSLError, ConnectionResetError, BrokenPipeError or TimeoutError data, do we need this? Potentially we can remove all the scuffed code just by skipping this...
* If JSONDecodeError happens twice in a row it will just skip writing that log and continue merrily away

## Installation

certmitm has been tested on Debian 11 and Debian 12. It should work on Linux with Python 3.10 and up

Install required python packages with

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Obtain real certificates such as a Let's Encrypt certificate and save them to [real_certs](real_certs)

## Usage

First you need to intercept TLS connections. The easies way for this is to configure the computer running certmitm to act as a router for other devices in the network.

For example:

1. Start a DHCP/DNS server

```
sudo ip addr add 10.0.0.1/24 dev eth0
sudo dnsmasq --no-daemon --interface eth0 --dhcp-range=10.0.0.100,10.0.0.200 --log-dhcp --log-queries --bind-interfaces -C /dev/null
```

2. Intercept TLS connections from the clients and redirect other connections to the internet through the WLAN interface

```
sudo iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 443 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 9900
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o wlan0 -j MASQUERADE
```

3. Start certmitm

```
python3 certmitm.py --listen 9900 --workdir testing --verbose --show-data
```

4. Connect clients to the network and start applications. Note that you might need to retry running the applications a couple of times while the tests fail.
